# Sender using Rabbit MQ

This project performs the following main activities:

- receiving a message via REST API
- publishing the message to a message queue

In order for this to work properly, you need to run a receiver
(rcvr project). To run a receiver, consult the README.adoc on the rcvr
project. You would also need to have access to a running Rabbit MQ 
server. Again, consult the rcvr project.


To run this application, you can run it from the Ecliipse IDE using Spring STS at 
`Boot Dashboard` or your can run at the command line inside the folder of this 
project as follows:

```
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

To change a REST API port number, update the application.properties file.
