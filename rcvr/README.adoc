# Receiver using Rabbit MQ

This project demonstrate how you can write a message queue receiver
in Spring Boot using Rabbit MQ.

In order to run this, you need to have a Rabbit MQ server runs some where
that this application can connect to so that it can serve the incoming messages.
To do that simply, I create a local Rabbit MQ server running on my Docker engine.
The command to create & run this Rabbit MQ on my local Docker is as follows:

```
docker run -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 -d --hostname my-rabbitmq-host --name my-rabittmq rabbitmq:3
```

To stop and remove it from my running instance, I use these two commands:

```
docker stop my-rabbitmq
docker rm my-rabbitmq
```

To run this application, you can run it from the Ecliipse IDE using Spring STS at 
`Boot Dashboard` or your can run at the command line inside the folder of this 
project as follows:

```
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
